# tf-aws-containers

This repo contains the following modules

- ecr
This module creates an Elastic Container Registry. 


## Re-using these templates

You will need to create an IAM user for terraform deployments. 
Then create the following secrets for your deployment pipeline. 
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

I'm using Github actions to deploy, which you can tell from the notation in the workflow file, of ${{ secrets.aws_access_key }}

## Naming Convention

If you look in defaults.tf, this repo uses a pair of variables to setup a naming convention. 

- var.project
- var.environment

This is to help reuse the code and create a lifecycle for bigger product teams.

```HCL
locals {
    resource_prefix = format("%s-%s", var.project, var.environment)
}
```

local.resource_prefix is then referenced wherever the name is required to follow the convention.

in main.tf the template name adopts the prefix.

```HCL
  name                = format("%s-%s", local.resource_prefix, "ebe-template-01")
```
